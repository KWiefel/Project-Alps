        <h3>Choose your Trip</h3>
        <p>
          We choose hotels which offer a great location, a high standard of
          comfort and quality, and a solid value to our guests. These inns offer
          a superbly satisfying mix of a welcoming atmosphere, traditional
          cuisine, and authentic charm. They are typically small,
          independently-owned properties which reflect the character and
          hospitality of the surrounding alpine community. We know the owners
          personally, have a longstanding relationship with them, and we find
          they bend over backwards to provide our guests with an exceptional
          experience.
